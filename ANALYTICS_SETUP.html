<!-- Google Analytics Setup Instructions -->

<!-- 
To add Google Analytics to your portfolio:

1. Go to https://analytics.google.com/
2. Create a new property for your website
3. Get your Measurement ID (looks like G-XXXXXXXXXX)
4. Replace 'G-XXXXXXXXXX' below with your actual Measurement ID
5. Add this code snippet to the <head> section of ALL your HTML files
   (index.html, projects.html, experience.html, hobbies.html, 404.html)
   Right after the opening <head> tag

-->

<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
